        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>Chocolate Chip Cookies</em> are a type of drop cookie that is
            known for its choclate chips. These chips come in many forms such as
            pieces of chocolate bars but they are mainly found in a chip form
            pre-packaged in grocery stores. Although cookies with chocolate baked in
            them have existed before, it is generally believed that the chocolate
            chip cookie originated in the United States by Ruth Graves Wakefield in
            1938 when she cut a chocolate bar and added it to cookie dough. Today
            chocolate chip cookies are made by beating a verity of ingredients
            together such as milk, flour, and eggs then stirring in the titular
            chocolate ingredient. Aftering making this dough it is seperated into
            pieces which are then baked and eaten.</p>
