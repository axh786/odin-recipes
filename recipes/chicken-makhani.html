        <p><em>Chicken Makhani</em> is a dish that orignated from Old Delhi,
            India in the 1950's by Kundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral. Jaggi and
            Gujral made the recipe by chance through mixing a buttery tomato sauce
            with chicken tandoori, another popular Indian recipe. Today, Chicken
            makhani is made very similarly with the tomato based curry
            or sauce having a variety of spices which is then mixed
            with the chicken and served with naan or over rice.</p>
