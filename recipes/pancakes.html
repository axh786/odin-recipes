        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>Pancakes</em> are an extremely popular flat cake that can trace its
            origins to the ancient greeks. Today in North America, pancakes are
            treated as a breakfast food known for its thickness and fluffiness.
            North American pancakes start off as a batter made of flour,
            sugar, butter, milk and eggs which is then cooked on a hot frying pan or
            griddle greased by butter or oil. After they are made, the flat cakes
            are then assembled in a stack, drizzled with honey or syrup, and a slice
            of butter on top. </p>
