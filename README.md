# odin-recipes
This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations course. The actual project involves creating a website with links to a couple of recipes. Once completed this project will display my HTML skills such as proper usage of relative and absolute links, well formatted HTML code, usage of tanks links and images, and most of all giving me practice with the language & git commits.
